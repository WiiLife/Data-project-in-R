## 1. Abstract

to be completed at a later date. Should be a brief synopsis of the main points discovered during research.

## 2. Introduction

Every moment, people make decisions about their daily lives, based on information from all around them. This information may come from a news article, a video on their phone, something said to them by a friend, or even official statistics from the government. There are in fact so many sources of information that it can be overwhelming to think about. In other words, there is tons of data all around us.

As students of data science, we are expected to look at this enormous amount of data and draw a few logical conclusions that can help the everyday person with their quality of life. Some day, we will be posed the question to analyse data from a topic we never even knew existed and make important decisions with it. The idea may seem alien to us right now, but it is a reality of our chosen profession.

To embody this strange feeling, we decided to take the metaphor literally and make ourselves into the most confused data scientists tasked with helping humanity: Aliens.

For the duration of this report, we will be using a select amount of data to draw relevant conclusions about the state of the our world, and more specifically, based around the topic of health and medicine, as minimally informed but well-meaning "aliens". We will base our exploration and experiments on generic data and attempt to advise different countries on how to improve their overall well-being, using metrics we will discuss later.

## 3. Data Exploration

### 3.1 Research questions

We are looking at this data project as aliens who are very logical but not very informed, and have a slice of data with which to assess the world. We know there are many different countries, that are separated by borders and each decide how to rule their own territories. We want to determine the best countries, using information inherent to the medical scope, and their primary features of influence. This will help us find ways to improve and suggest improvements to countries doing less well.

We would like to find out:

-   What are the best outcomes for a country, and what are the primary influencing features for these outcomes;
-   Using the most influential features found above, can we determine a given country's continent of origin
-   As a country that is not doing well, which features should it improve;
-   binary calssification (phrase better)

### 3.2 Data cleaning

The datasets we chose represent data from the WHO, found on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) at [World Health Statistics 2020\|Complete\|Geo-Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshxy/who-worldhealth-statistics-2020-complete), curated by [Zeus](https://www.kaggle.com/utkarshxy).

The data we chose is separated into many different files, each of which only contains only one or two different features describing the state of the world, divided by country and by year. To use data like this, we need to determine which are the most relevant features for our research questions and how to evaluate them.

Our first step is to separate the features into variables we can use to evaluate the state of a country (outcome variables) and variables which influence the state of a country (decision variables). As an example, let's use the idea of getting to work on time: the outcome of "being on time" or "being late" depends on the decision variable "time of leaving the house". The decision to leave earlier may allow you to arrive on time to work, even if there are other variables that also influence the outcome like the presence of traffic.

To make every research question meaningful, all data sets used to find experiments and answers belong to the same time periods. We will select relevant features and time periods appropriately.

## 4. Experiments and findings

### 4.1 Question 1

Our first research question surrounds the general state of the countries in our data set. Can we determine what the best outcome for a country is and how it is affected by the available decision variables.

First of all we need to decide what is "the best" country. This could mean the least mortality, the highest life expectancy at birth, the least amount of suicides or many other things. To find an overall score for what could be the best, we selected the a recent year in the dataframe for which we have a good amount of data, and looked for that year's happiness index.

Below is the list form of the happiness scores of the countries for which data was available in 2017, found at [vividmaps.com](https://vividmaps.com/happiness-index/).

Let's compare the features for 2017 of the top 10 countries by happiness in 2017, so as to get a good idea of what the "best" country is determined by. More specifically, let's have a look at those we have designated as outcome variables.

```{r}

best_countries <- names(happiness_map)[1:10]



```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
